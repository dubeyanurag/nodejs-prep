### Technical Challenges

#### 1. Global Transaction Routing
```javascript
// Simplified transaction routing logic
class TransactionRouter {
  async routeTransaction(transaction) {
    const region = this.determineOptimalRegion(transaction);
    const processor = this.selectProcessor(transaction.paymentMethod, region);
    
    // Implement circuit breaker pattern
    if (this.circuitBreaker.isOpen(processor)) {
      return this.fallbackProcessor(transaction);
    }
    
    return this.processWithRetry(transaction, processor);
  }
  
  determineOptimalRegion(transaction) {
    // Consider: latency, compliance, processor availability
    const factors = {
      userLocation: transaction.customer.country,
      cardIssuer: transaction.card.issuerCountry,
      merchantLocation: transaction.merchant.country,
      regulatoryRequirements: this.getComplianceRequirements(transaction)
    };
    
    return this.regionSelector.optimize(factors);
  }
}
```

#### 2. Idempotency and Duplicate Prevention
```javascript
// Idempotency key implementation
class IdempotencyManager {
  async processPayment(paymentIntent, idempotencyKey) {
    // Check if we've seen this idempotency key before
    const existingResult = await this.redis.get(`idem:${idempotencyKey}`);
    if (existingResult) {
      return JSON.parse(existingResult);
    }
    
    // Use distributed lock to prevent race conditions
    const lock = await this.acquireLock(`lock:${idempotencyKey}`, 30000);
    if (!lock) {
      throw new Error('Unable to acquire idempotency lock');
    }
    
    try {
      const result = await this.executePayment(paymentIntent);
      
      // Store result with TTL (24 hours)
      await this.redis.setex(`idem:${idempotencyKey}`, 86400, JSON.stringify(result));
      
      return result;
    } finally {
      await this.releaseLock(lock);
    }
  }

    }
  }
  
  async processOffline(encryptedPayment) {
    // Generate local transaction ID
    const localTxnId = this.generateLocalTxnId();
    
    // Store in encrypted local queue
    await this.localQueue.enqueue({
      localTxnId,
      encryptedPayment,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      status: 'pending_sync'
    });
    
    // Return optimistic response
    return {
      transactionId: localTxnId,
      status: 'pending',

      }
    }
    
    return results;
  }
  
  async syncTransaction(localTxn) {
    // Check for duplicates on server
    const serverTxn = await this.checkForDuplicate(localTxn);
    
    if (serverTxn) {
      // Handle duplicate - update local record
      return await this.reconcileDuplicate(localTxn, serverTxn);
