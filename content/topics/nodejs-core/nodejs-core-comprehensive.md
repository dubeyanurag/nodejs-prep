# Node.js Core: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Node.js is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications across distributed devices.

## Core Components and Architecture

### 1. V8 JavaScript Engine

V8 is Google's open-source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. Node.js uses V8 to execute JavaScript code. V8 compiles JavaScript directly into machine code before executing it, which contributes to Node.js's high performance.

### 2. libuv

libuv is a multi-platform C library that provides asynchronous I/O. It's the backbone of Node.js's non-blocking nature, handling tasks like file system operations, networking, concurrency, and more, by leveraging the operating system's capabilities. It includes:
*   **Event Loop**: Orchestrates asynchronous operations (see dedicated [Event Loop topic](./event-loop.md)).
*   **Thread Pool**: Manages a pool of worker threads (typically 4 by default) for CPU-bound tasks and blocking I/O operations (like file I/O or DNS lookups) to prevent blocking the main event loop.

    end

    C --> F
```

## Global Objects and Process Management

Node.js provides several global objects that are available in all modules without requiring explicit `require()`.

### `global` Object

Similar to `window` in browsers, `global` is the global namespace object.

```javascript
global.myGlobalVariable = 'Hello from global!';
console.log(myGlobalVariable); // Accessible everywhere
```

### `process` Object

The `process` object provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process.

```javascript
// Current working directory
console.log('Current directory:', process.cwd());

// Environment variables
console.log('Node environment:', process.env.NODE_ENV);

// Process ID
console.log('Process ID:', process.pid);

// Uptime
console.log('Uptime:', process.uptime(), 'seconds');

// Exit the process
// process.exit(0); // Exits cleanly
// process.exit(1); // Exits with an error code

// Event listeners for process lifecycle
process.on('exit', (code) => {
  console.log(`Process exited with code: ${code}`);
});

process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
  console.error('Uncaught Exception:', err);
  // Log the error, perform cleanup, then gracefully exit
  process.exit(1);
});
```

## Modules: CommonJS vs. ES Modules

Node.js primarily uses the CommonJS module system. ES Modules (ESM) are also supported and are becoming the standard.

### CommonJS (CJS)

*   **Synchronous loading**: Modules are loaded synchronously.
*   **`require()` and `module.exports` / `exports`**: Used for importing and exporting.
*   **`__dirname` and `__filename`**: Global-like variables specific to the module's file path.

```javascript
// math.js (CommonJS module)
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

module.exports = {
  add,
  subtract
};

// app.js
const math = require('./math');
console.log(math.add(5, 3)); // 8
```

### ES Modules (ESM)

*   **Asynchronous loading**: Modules can be loaded asynchronously.
*   **`import` and `export`**: Standard syntax.
*   **No `__dirname` or `__filename`**: Use `import.meta.url` for similar functionality.
*   Requires `.mjs` extension or `"type": "module"` in `package.json`.

```javascript
// math.mjs (ES Module)
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

// app.mjs
import { add } from './math.mjs';
console.log(add(5, 3)); // 8
```

## File System (fs Module)

The `fs` module provides an API for interacting with the file system. It offers synchronous and asynchronous methods. Prefer asynchronous methods to avoid blocking the Event Loop.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const fsPromises = require('fs').promises; // Promise-based API

// Asynchronous (callback-based)
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error reading file (callback):', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('File content (callback):', data);
});

// Asynchronous (Promise-based)
async function readFilePromise() {
  try {
    const data = await fsPromises.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log('File content (promise):', data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error reading file (promise):', err);
  }
}
readFilePromise();

// Synchronous (blocking - avoid for critical paths)
try {
  const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
  console.log('File content (sync):', data);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Error reading file (sync):', err);
}
```

## Networking (net, http, https Modules)

Node.js's core strength lies in its networking capabilities.

### `net` Module (TCP/IP)

Provides an asynchronous network API for creating stream-based TCP or IPC servers and clients.

```javascript
const net = require('net');

// TCP Server
const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  console.log('Client connected.');
  socket.write('Hello from TCP server!\r\n');
  socket.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log(`Received from client: ${data.toString().trim()}`);
  });
  socket.on('end', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected.');
  });
});

server.listen(3001, () => {
  console.log('TCP server listening on port 3001');
});

// TCP Client
const client = net.createConnection({ port: 3001 }, () => {
  console.log('Connected to TCP server!');
  client.write('Hello TCP server!');
});

client.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(`Received from server: ${data.toString().trim()}`);
  client.end(); // Close connection after receiving data
});

client.on('end', () => {
  console.log('Disconnected from TCP server.');
});
```

### `http` and `https` Modules (HTTP/HTTPS)

Used for creating web servers and making HTTP/HTTPS requests.

```javascript
const http = require('http');

// HTTP Server
const httpServer = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello from HTTP server!');
});

httpServer.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('HTTP server listening on port 3000');
});

// HTTP Client (making a request)
http.get('http://localhost:3000', (res) => {
  let data = '';
  res.on('data', (chunk) => {
    data += chunk;
  });
  res.on('end', () => {
    console.log('HTTP Client received:', data);
  });
}).on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('HTTP Client error:', err.message);
});
```

## Design Patterns in Node.js Core

Node.js's core modules inherently demonstrate several design patterns.

### 1. Observer Pattern (Event Emitters)

The `EventEmitter` class is a prime example of the Observer pattern, allowing objects to subscribe to and emit events.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

myEmitter.on('userLoggedIn', (username) => {
  console.log(`${username} logged in. Sending welcome email.`);
});

myEmitter.emit('userLoggedIn', 'Alice');
```

### 2. Middleware Pattern (HTTP/Connect)

Common in web frameworks like Express.js, but the concept is present in Node.js's `http` module.

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const loggerMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url} at ${new Date().toISOString()}`);
  next();
};

const authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.headers.authorization === 'Bearer secret_token') {
    next();
  } else {
    res.writeHead(401, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Unauthorized');
  }
};

const finalHandler = (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Access granted!');
};

// Simple middleware chain
const middlewares = [loggerMiddleware, authMiddleware, finalHandler];

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  let index = 0;
  const next = () => {
    const middleware = middlewares[index++];
    if (middleware) {
      middleware(req, res, next);
    }
  };
  next();
}).listen(3002);

console.log('Middleware example server listening on port 3002');
```

### 3. Stream Pattern

The `Stream` module (used by `fs`, `http`, `net`) implements a form of the Iterator and Producer-Consumer patterns for handling data in chunks.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('large_file.txt', 'utf8');
const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('copy_of_large_file.txt');

readableStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);
  writableStream.write(chunk); // Write data to destination
});

readableStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('Finished reading file.');
  writableStream.end();
});

readableStream.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error reading stream:', err);
});
```

## Interview Questions & Answers

### Question 1: What is Node.js built on and how do its core components interact?
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Category**: Node.js Core

**Answer**: Node.js is built on Chrome's **V8 JavaScript engine** for executing JavaScript code and the **libuv library** for handling asynchronous I/O operations.
*   **V8**: Compiles JavaScript into machine code.
*   **libuv**: Provides the **Event Loop** (for non-blocking I/O orchestration) and a **Thread Pool** (for blocking I/O and CPU-bound tasks).
When Node.js encounters a non-blocking operation (like a network request), it hands it off to libuv, which uses OS-level asynchronous APIs or its thread pool. The main V8 thread remains free to execute other JavaScript code. Once the asynchronous operation completes, a callback is placed in the Event Loop's queue, and when the V8 thread is idle, it picks up and executes the callback.

### Question 2: Explain the difference between `require()` and `import` in Node.js.
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Category**: Modules

**Answer**:
*   **`require()`**: Used in CommonJS modules. It's a synchronous operation, meaning modules are loaded one by one. It loads the module at the point it's called and caches it for subsequent calls. Variables like `__dirname` and `__filename` are available.
*   **`import` / `export`**: Used in ES Modules (ESM). It's an asynchronous operation (though often behaves synchronously due to static analysis). It's part of the JavaScript language standard. Modules are statically analyzed, allowing for optimizations like tree-shaking. `__dirname` and `__filename` are not directly available. ESM requires `.mjs` file extension or `"type": "module"` in `package.json`.

### Question 3: How does Node.js handle concurrency with its single-threaded nature?
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Category**: Concurrency

**Answer**: Node.js uses a single-threaded Event Loop for executing JavaScript code. Concurrency is achieved by offloading I/O operations (like reading files, network requests) to the underlying `libuv` library, which utilizes the operating system's asynchronous capabilities or a thread pool for these tasks. When an I/O operation completes, its callback is placed in the Event Loop's queue. The single JavaScript thread processes these callbacks when it's not busy executing other synchronous code, creating the illusion of concurrency without true parallelism of JavaScript execution.

### Question 4: When would you use `process.nextTick()` vs `setImmediate()`?
**Difficulty**: Advanced
**Category**: Event Loop

**Answer**: Both `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()` schedule code to be executed asynchronously, but they operate in different phases of the Event Loop:
*   **`process.nextTick()`**: Executes callbacks immediately, at the end of the current operation, but before the Event Loop moves to the next phase. It has higher priority than `setImmediate()` and Promise microtasks. Use it for deferring execution to prevent stack overflows or to handle errors synchronously from an otherwise asynchronous operation.
*   **`setImmediate()`**: Executes callbacks in the `check` phase of the Event Loop, after the `poll` phase. It's ideal for breaking up CPU-bound tasks into smaller chunks that can yield control to the Event Loop, preventing it from being blocked.

### Question 5: Describe the role of Streams in Node.js and provide a use case.
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Category**: Streams

**Answer**: Streams are a fundamental concept in Node.js for handling data in a continuous flow, rather than loading the entire data into memory at once. They are instances of `EventEmitter` and allow data to be read from a source or written to a destination in chunks.

**Use Case**: Processing large files without exhausting memory.
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const { Transform } = require('stream');

// Create a custom transform stream to convert data to uppercase
const upperCaseTransform = new Transform({
  transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    this.push(chunk.toString().toUpperCase());
    callback();
  }
});

// Read from a large file, pipe through the transform stream, and write to another file
fs.createReadStream('input.txt')
  .pipe(upperCaseTransform)
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'))
  .on('finish', () => console.log('File processed and saved!'))
  .on('error', (err) => console.error('Stream error:', err));
```

### Question 6: How would you structure a Node.js project for scalability and maintainability?
**Difficulty**: Senior
**Category**: Architecture

**Answer**: For scalability and maintainability, a modular and layered architecture is recommended. Common approaches include:

1.  **Layered Architecture**: Separation of concerns into distinct layers (e.g., Presentation/Controller, Service/Business Logic, Data Access/Repository).
2.  **Modular Design**: Organize code into features or domains, with each module containing its own controllers, services, and models.
3.  **Dependency Injection**: Use DI containers or constructor injection to manage dependencies, promoting loose coupling and testability.
4.  **Configuration Management**: Centralize configuration and use environment variables for different environments.
5.  **Error Handling**: Implement global error handling middleware and custom error classes.
6.  **Validation**: Use schema validation (e.g., Joi, Yup) for incoming requests.

**Example Structure (Modular/Layered):**
```

├── app.js             # Main application entry point
├── config/            # Environment-specific configurations
├── middleware/        # Global Express middleware (auth, logging)
├── modules/           # Feature-based modules (e.g., users, products, orders)
│   ├── user/

├── utils/             # Reusable utility functions
├── tests/             # Unit, integration, e2e tests
├── logs/
└── package.json
```

### Question 7: What are the best practices for handling environment variables and sensitive data in Node.js?
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Category**: Security

**Answer**:
1.  **Use `.env` files for local development**: Store non-sensitive environment variables in a `.env` file (e.g., using `dotenv` package) and add it to `.gitignore`.
2.  **Environment Variables in Production**: For production, use the hosting environment's native mechanisms (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, Azure Key Vault, process managers like PM2 or systemd) to inject environment variables.
3.  **Never hardcode sensitive data**: Pass database credentials, API keys, and other secrets as environment variables, not directly in code.
4.  **Encryption for Sensitive Data at Rest**: For highly sensitive data, consider application-level encryption before storing in databases, even if the database itself provides encryption.
5.  **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure that only necessary services or users have access to specific environment variables or secrets.

**Example (`.env` usage with `dotenv`):**
```javascript
// app.js
require('dotenv').config(); // Load .env file at the very beginning

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const DB_HOST = process.env.DB_HOST;
const DB_USER = process.env.DB_USER;
const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET; // Sensitive data

console.log(`Connecting to database at ${DB_HOST} as ${DB_USER}`);
// console.log(`JWT Secret: ${JWT_SECRET}`); // Avoid logging secrets in production

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('App is running!');
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```
</environment_details>
