# Node.js Streams: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Streams are a fundamental concept in Node.js for handling data in a continuous, efficient manner. They are powerful for working with large amounts of data, where processing the entire data set at once might be memory-intensive or slow.

## Core Concepts

### What are Streams?

Streams are abstract interfaces in Node.js for working with streaming data. They are instances of `EventEmitter` and allow data to be processed chunk by chunk, rather than loading the entire data into memory. This makes them highly efficient for I/O operations like reading from or writing to files, network communications, and data transformations.

### Types of Streams

There are four fundamental types of streams in Node.js:

1.  **Readable Streams**: Streams from which data can be read (e.g., `fs.createReadStream()`).
2.  **Writable Streams**: Streams to which data can be written (e.g., `fs.createWriteStream()`).
3.  **Duplex Streams**: Streams that are both Readable and Writable (e.g., `net.Socket`).
4.  **Transform Streams**: Duplex streams that can modify or transform the data as it is written and then read (e.g., `zlib.createGzip()`).

## Working with Streams

### Readable Stream Example

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt', { encoding: 'utf8', highWaterMark: 16 * 1024 }); // 16KB chunks

readableStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);
  console.log(chunk);
});

readableStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('Finished reading data.');
});

readableStream.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error reading stream:', err);
});
```

### Writable Stream Example

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt', { encoding: 'utf8' });

writableStream.write('Hello, World!\n');
writableStream.write('This is a writable stream example.\n');
writableStream.end('Ending the stream.'); // Signals that no more data will be written

writableStream.on('finish', () => {
  console.log('All data has been written to file.');
});

writableStream.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error writing stream:', err);
});
```

### Piping Streams

Piping is the simplest way to connect two streams. It takes the output of a readable stream and pipes it as input to a writable stream.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const zlib = require('zlib'); // For gzip transformation

// Create a readable stream from a file
const readable = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');

// Create a transform stream (gzip compressor)
const gzip = zlib.createGzip();

// Create a writable stream to a file
const writable = fs.createWriteStream('input.txt.gz');

// Pipe the data: readable -> gzip -> writable
readable.pipe(gzip).pipe(writable);

writable.on('finish', () => {
  console.log('File compressed successfully!');
});

writable.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error during piping:', err);
});
```

## Backpressure

Backpressure is a mechanism that prevents a faster readable stream from overwhelming a slower writable stream. When a writable stream cannot process data as fast as it is being supplied, it signals back to the readable stream to pause.

### Handling Backpressure Manually (Less Common with `pipe()`)

While `pipe()` handles backpressure automatically, understanding the underlying mechanism is important.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const readable = fs.createReadStream('large_input.txt');
const writable = fs.createWriteStream('large_output.txt');

readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
  // If write() returns false, it means the internal buffer is full
  // and we should pause the readable stream.
  if (!writable.write(chunk)) {
    readable.pause();
  }
});

writable.on('drain', () => {
  // When the internal buffer of the writable stream is drained,
  // it emits 'drain', and we can resume the readable stream.
  readable.resume();
});

readable.on('end', () => {
  writable.end(); // No more data to write, end the writable stream
});

readable.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error reading:', err);
  writable.destroy(); // Destroy writable stream on read error
});

writable.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error writing:', err);
  readable.destroy(); // Destroy readable stream on write error
});
```

## Interview Questions & Answers

### Question 1: What are Node.js Streams and why are they important?
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Category**: Core Concepts

**Answer**: Node.js Streams are abstract interfaces for handling data in a continuous, chunk-by-chunk manner. They are important because they allow efficient processing of large datasets without loading the entire data into memory, thus saving memory and improving performance for I/O-bound operations.

### Question 2: Explain backpressure in Node.js streams.
**Difficulty**: Advanced
**Category**: Performance

**Answer**: Backpressure is a flow control mechanism in Node.js streams that prevents a faster readable stream from overwhelming a slower writable stream. When the writable stream's internal buffer is full, its `write()` method returns `false`, signaling the readable stream to `pause()`. Once the writable stream's buffer drains, it emits a `drain` event, signaling the readable stream to `resume()`. The `pipe()` method handles backpressure automatically.
