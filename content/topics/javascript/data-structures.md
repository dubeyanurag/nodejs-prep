# Advanced JavaScript Data Structures

## Introduction

ES6 introduced several new data structures that provide more efficient ways to handle collections of data. This guide covers `Set`, `Map`, `WeakSet`, and `WeakMap`.

## Set

A `Set` is a collection of unique values. You can store any type of value in a `Set`, whether primitive or object references.

### Key Features

*   **Uniqueness**: A value in the `Set` may only occur once.
*   **Order**: Elements are iterated in insertion order.
*   **Methods**: `add()`, `has()`, `delete()`, `clear()`, `size`.

### Code Example

```javascript
const mySet = new Set();

mySet.add(1);
mySet.add(5);
mySet.add(5); // This will be ignored
mySet.add('some text');

console.log(mySet.has(1));      // Output: true
console.log(mySet.size);        // Output: 3

mySet.delete(5);
console.log(mySet.size);        // Output: 2

for (const item of mySet) {
  console.log(item); // 1, "some text"
}
```

## Map

A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs where both the keys and values can be of any type.

### Key Features

*   **Key Types**: Keys can be any value (including functions, objects, or any primitive).
*   **Order**: Keys are iterated in insertion order.
*   **Methods**: `set()`, `get()`, `has()`, `delete()`, `clear()`, `size`.

### Code Example

```javascript
const myMap = new Map();

const keyString = 'a string';
const keyObj = {};
const keyFunc = function() {};

myMap.set(keyString, "value associated with 'a string'");
myMap.set(keyObj, 'value associated with keyObj');
myMap.set(keyFunc, 'value associated with keyFunc');

console.log(myMap.get(keyString)); // "value associated with 'a string'"
console.log(myMap.size); // 3
```

## Map

### Underlying Principles and Performance Characteristics

Both `Map` and `Set` in JavaScript are typically implemented using hash tables (or hash maps) under the hood. This allows for efficient average-case time complexity for common operations.

#### Time Complexity (Average Case)

| Operation | `Map` / `Set` | `Object` (for comparison) | `Array` (for comparison) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Insertion** | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) (push/pop), O(N) (unshift/splice) |
| **Deletion** | O(1) | O(1) | O(N) |
| **Lookup (`has`/`get`)** | O(1) | O(1) | O(N) |
| **Iteration** | O(N) | O(N) | O(N) |

**Note**: The worst-case time complexity for hash table operations can be O(N) in the event of many hash collisions, but modern JavaScript engines employ strategies to minimize this.

#### Benefits over `Object` for Key-Value Pairs

While plain JavaScript objects can be used as key-value stores, `Map` offers several advantages:
*   **Arbitrary Keys**: `Map` keys can be any value (objects, functions, primitives), whereas `Object` keys are implicitly converted to strings. This prevents unexpected behavior due to key coercion.
*   **Iteration Order**: `Map` preserves insertion order, meaning elements are iterated in the order they were added. `Object` key order is not guaranteed (though modern engines generally preserve insertion order for string keys).
*   **`size` Property**: `Map` has a direct `size` property for easy counting of elements, while `Object` requires `Object.keys().length`.
*   **Performance for Frequent Add/Delete**: `Map` instances are optimized for scenarios involving frequent additions and deletions of key-value pairs.

## WeakMap

A `WeakMap` is similar to a `Map`, but it only holds "weak" references to its keys. This means that if there are no other references to a key object, it can be garbage collected.

### Key Features

*   **Keys**: Keys must be objects. Primitive values are not allowed.
*   **Weak References**: Keys are held weakly, allowing for garbage collection.
*   **Not Enumerable**: You cannot iterate over the keys or values of a `WeakMap`.

### Use Case: Caching

`WeakMap` is useful for caching data associated with an object, where you don't want the cache to prevent the object from being garbage collected.

```javascript
let obj = { name: 'Alice' };
const cache = new WeakMap();
cache.set(obj, { data: 'some cached data' });

// When obj is no longer used, it can be garbage collected
obj = null; 
// The entry in the cache will also be removed
```

## WeakSet

A `WeakSet` is similar to a `Set`, but it only holds "weak" references to its objects.

### Key Features

*   **Values**: Values must be objects.
*   **Weak References**: Objects are held weakly.
*   **Not Enumerable**: You cannot iterate over the values of a `WeakSet`.

### Use Case: Tracking Object References

`WeakSet` can be used to track a collection of objects without preventing them from being garbage collected.

```javascript
const activeUsers = new WeakSet();

class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    activeUsers.add(this);
  }
}

let user1 = new User('Bob');
let user2 = new User('Charlie');

console.log(activeUsers.has(user1)); // true

user1 = null;
// user1 can now be garbage collected, and will be removed from the WeakSet
```

## Interview Questions & Answers

### Question 1: When would you use a `Map` over a plain `Object`?
**Difficulty**: Junior
**Category**: Core Concepts

**Answer**: Use a `Map` when you need to use non-string keys, want to maintain insertion order, or need to frequently add and remove key-value pairs (as `Map` can be more performant in such scenarios).

### Question 2: What is the main benefit of `WeakMap` over `Map`?
**Difficulty**: Mid-Level
**Category**: Application

**Answer**: The main benefit of `WeakMap` is that it allows for garbage collection of its keys if they are no longer referenced elsewhere in the program. This helps prevent memory leaks, especially in caching scenarios.

### Question 3: When would you use a `Set` over an `Array`?
**Difficulty**: Junior
**Category**: Core Concepts

**Answer**: You would use a `Set` over an `Array` primarily when:
1.  **You need to store unique values**: `Set` automatically handles uniqueness, preventing duplicate entries. With an `Array`, you'd need manual logic (e.g., iterating and checking `indexOf` or `includes`) to ensure uniqueness, which can be less efficient.
2.  **You need fast membership testing**: Checking if an element exists in a `Set` (`mySet.has(value)`) is, on average, an O(1) operation due to its hash-table like implementation. For an `Array`, `myArray.includes(value)` is an O(N) operation.
3.  **Order of elements is not critical, or insertion order is sufficient**: While `Set` maintains insertion order, if you need to access elements by index or a specific custom sort order, an `Array` is more suitable.

**Example**:
```javascript
// Checking uniqueness
const numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
const uniqueNumbersArray = [...new Set(numbers)]; // Efficiently get unique values
console.log(uniqueNumbersArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// Fast lookup
const largeSet = new Set(Array.from({ length: 100000 }, (_, i) => i));
const largeArray = Array.from({ length: 100000 }, (_, i) => i);

console.time('Set has');
largeSet.has(99999);
console.timeEnd('Set has'); // Much faster

console.time('Array includes');
largeArray.includes(99999);
console.timeEnd('Array includes'); // Slower
```

### Question 4: Explain the concept of "weak references" as used in `WeakMap` and `WeakSet`.
**Difficulty**: Advanced
**Category**: Memory Management

**Answer**: Weak references are references to objects that do not prevent the garbage collector from reclaiming the object's memory if there are no other strong references to it.

In `WeakMap` and `WeakSet`:
*   **`WeakMap`**: Its keys are weakly held. If an object used as a key in a `WeakMap` is no longer referenced anywhere else in the program, the garbage collector can reclaim that object's memory. When the object is garbage collected, its corresponding entry (key-value pair) is automatically removed from the `WeakMap`.
*   **`WeakSet`**: Its values are weakly held. If an object stored as a value in a `WeakSet` is no longer referenced elsewhere, it can be garbage collected, and the object is automatically removed from the `WeakSet`.

**Main Benefit**: This prevents memory leaks. For example, if you use a regular `Map` to cache data associated with DOM elements (where the DOM element is the key), and then the DOM element is removed from the document, the `Map` would still hold a strong reference to that element, preventing it from being garbage collected. A `WeakMap` automatically cleans up these entries when the key object is no longer in use, making it ideal for associating metadata with objects that might have a limited lifecycle.

**Limitations**: Because entries can be garbage collected at any time, `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` are not enumerable (you cannot iterate over their keys/values or get their `size`), as their contents are non-deterministic.
