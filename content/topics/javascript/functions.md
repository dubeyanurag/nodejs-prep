# JavaScript Functions: A Deep Dive

## Introduction

Functions are a cornerstone of JavaScript. This guide covers the differences between normal and arrow functions, and the use of `bind`, `call`, and `apply` to control the `this` context.

## Normal vs. Arrow Functions

### Normal Functions (Function Declarations and Expressions)

Normal functions can be defined as declarations or expressions. They have their own `this` context, which is determined by how they are called.

```javascript
// Function Declaration
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}

// Function Expression
const greet2 = function(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
};
```

### Arrow Functions

Arrow functions, introduced in ES6, have a more concise syntax and do not have their own `this` context. They inherit `this` from the parent scope.

```javascript
const greetArrow = (name) => `Hello, ${name}`;

const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet: function() {
    // 'this' refers to the person object
    setTimeout(() => {
      // 'this' is inherited from the parent scope (greet function)
      console.log(`Hello from ${this.name}`);
    }, 100);
  }
};

person.greet(); // Output: Hello from Alice
```

## Controlling `this`: `bind`, `call`, and `apply`

### `call()`

The `call()` method calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually.

```javascript
const car = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  getBrand: function() {
    return this.brand;
  }
};

const anotherCar = { brand: 'Audi' };

console.log(car.getBrand.call(anotherCar)); // Output: Audi
```

### `apply()`

The `apply()` method is similar to `call()`, but it takes arguments as an array.

```javascript
function introduce(greeting, punctuation) {
  console.log(`${greeting}, I am ${this.name}${punctuation}`);
}

const user = { name: 'Bob' };

introduce.apply(user, ['Hi', '!']); // Output: Hi, I am Bob!
```

### `bind()`

The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value. It's useful for event handlers and callbacks.

```javascript
const module = {
  x: 42,
  getX: function() {
    return this.x;
  }
};

const unboundGetX = module.getX;
console.log(unboundGetX()); // Output: undefined (this is the global object or undefined in strict mode)

const boundGetX = module.getX.bind(module);
console.log(boundGetX()); // Output: 42
```

## Interview Questions & Answers

### Question 1: What are the main differences between normal and arrow functions?
**Difficulty**: Junior
**Category**: Core Concepts

**Answer**: 
1.  **`this` binding**: Arrow functions do not have their own `this`. They inherit it from the parent scope. Normal functions have their own `this`, determined by how they are called.
2.  **`arguments` object**: Arrow functions do not have their own `arguments` object.
3.  **Constructor**: Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors and will throw an error when used with `new`.

### Question 2: When would you use `bind()` over `call()` or `apply()`?
**Difficulty**: Mid-Level
**Category**: Application

**Answer**: Use `bind()` when you want to create a new function with a specific `this` context that can be called later, such as in event listeners or callbacks. Use `call()` or `apply()` when you want to invoke the function immediately with a different `this` context.
