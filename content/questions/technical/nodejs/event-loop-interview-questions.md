# Node.js Event Loop Interview Questions

## Quick Read - Executive Summary

### Key Points
- **Event Loop Phases**: Timer, Pending Callbacks, Idle/Prepare, Poll, Check, Close Callbacks
- **Microtasks vs Macrotasks**: Process.nextTick and Promises (microtasks) execute before setTimeout/setInterval (macrotasks)
- **Performance Impact**: Blocking operations can starve the event loop and degrade application performance
- **Real-world Scenarios**: CPU-intensive tasks, large file operations, and synchronous database queries are common culprits

### Critical Concepts
1. **Phase Priority**: Each phase has a specific purpose and execution order
2. **Queue Processing**: Microtask queue is processed completely before moving to next phase
3. **Blocking Prevention**: Use async/await, streams, and worker threads for heavy operations
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Event loop lag monitoring is crucial for production applications

## Fundamental Event Loop Questions

### 1. What is the Node.js Event Loop and how does it work?
**Expected Answer**: The event loop is the core mechanism that allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations. It's a single-threaded loop that processes callbacks from various phases: timers, pending callbacks, idle/prepare, poll, check, and close callbacks. Each phase has a FIFO queue of callbacks to execute.

### 2. Explain the six phases of the Event Loop in detail.
**Expected Answer**: 
- **Timers**: Executes callbacks scheduled by setTimeout() and setInterval()
- **Pending Callbacks**: Executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration
- **Idle, Prepare**: Internal use only
- **Poll**: Fetches new I/O events; executes I/O related callbacks
- **Check**: Executes setImmediate() callbacks
- **Close Callbacks**: Executes close event callbacks (e.g., socket.on('close'))

### 3. What's the difference between microtasks and macrotasks?
**Expected Answer**: Microtasks (process.nextTick, Promise callbacks) have higher priority and are executed completely before any macrotasks. Macrotasks include setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate, and I/O operations. The microtask queue is drained after each phase.

### 4. How does process.nextTick() differ from setImmediate()?
**Expected Answer**: process.nextTick() callbacks are executed at the end of the current phase, before moving to the next phase. setImmediate() callbacks are executed in the check phase. process.nextTick() has higher priority.

### 5. What happens when you have nested process.nextTick() calls?
**Expected Answer**: This can cause "starvation" where the event loop gets stuck processing nextTick callbacks indefinitely, preventing other phases from executing. Node.js limits this with a maximum queue depth.

## Execution Order Questions

### 6. Predict the output of this code:
```javascript
console.log('start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);
process.nextTick(() => console.log('nextTick'));
setImmediate(() => console.log('immediate'));
console.log('end');
```
**Expected Answer**: start, end, nextTick, timeout, immediate

### 7. What's the execution order when mixing Promises and timers?
```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log('timer'), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise'));
process.nextTick(() => console.log('nextTick'));
```
**Expected Answer**: nextTick, promise, timer

### 8. How do nested setImmediate and setTimeout interact?
**Expected Answer**: The order depends on when they're called. If called from the main thread, setTimeout typically executes first. If called from within an I/O callback, setImmediate executes first.

### 9. What happens with multiple process.nextTick() and Promise.resolve()?
```javascript
process.nextTick(() => console.log('nextTick 1'));
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise 1'));
process.nextTick(() => console.log('nextTick 2'));
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise 2'));
```
**Expected Answer**: nextTick 1, nextTick 2, promise 1, promise 2

### 10. Explain the behavior of this recursive setTimeout:
```javascript
function recursiveTimeout() {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('timeout');
    recursiveTimeout();
  }, 0);
}
```
**Expected Answer**: Creates a continuous loop of timer callbacks, but allows other phases to execute between iterations, unlike a while loop.

## Performance and Blocking Questions

### 11. How can you detect if the event loop is blocked?
**Expected Answer**: Monitor event loop lag using libraries like `@nodejs/clinic` or custom monitoring with `process.hrtime()`. High lag indicates blocking operations.

### 12. What are common causes of event loop blocking?
**Expected Answer**: Synchronous file operations, CPU-intensive calculations, large JSON parsing, synchronous database queries, and infinite loops in callbacks.

### 13. How would you fix this blocking code?
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const data = fs.readFileSync('large-file.txt'); // Blocking
```
**Expected Answer**: Use async version: `fs.readFile()` or streams for large files, or use worker threads for CPU-intensive processing.

### 14. What's the impact of blocking the event loop in a web server?
**Expected Answer**: All incoming requests are queued and delayed, leading to poor response times, timeouts, and potential server crashes under load.

### 15. How do you handle CPU-intensive tasks without blocking?
**Expected Answer**: Use worker threads, child processes, or break tasks into smaller chunks using setImmediate() or process.nextTick() to yield control.

## Real-World Scenario Questions

### 16. Your Node.js API suddenly becomes slow. How do you diagnose event loop issues?
**Expected Answer**: Use profiling tools (clinic.js, 0x), monitor event loop lag, check for synchronous operations, analyze CPU usage, and implement proper logging.

### 17. How would you implement a non-blocking file processing system?
**Expected Answer**: Use streams, process files in chunks, implement queuing with concurrency limits, use worker threads for heavy processing, and provide progress feedback.

### 18. Explain how to handle thousands of concurrent database connections.
**Expected Answer**: Use connection pooling, implement proper async/await patterns, avoid synchronous queries, use streaming for large datasets, and monitor connection limits.

### 19. How do you prevent memory leaks in event loop callbacks?
**Expected Answer**: Clear timers and intervals, remove event listeners, avoid closures holding large objects, use weak references where appropriate, and implement proper error handling.

### 20. Design a rate limiter that doesn't block the event loop.
**Expected Answer**: Use in-memory stores (Redis), implement sliding window algorithms, use async operations, and leverage timers for cleanup without blocking.

## Company-Specific Questions

### 21. Google: How would you optimize event loop performance for a real-time chat application?
**Expected Answer**: Implement WebSocket connections, use efficient data structures, minimize callback nesting, implement proper error handling, use clustering for scalability, and monitor event loop lag.

### 22. Amazon: Explain how AWS Lambda's event loop differs from traditional Node.js servers.
**Expected Answer**: Lambda has cold starts, limited execution time, different memory constraints, and the event loop must complete before the function ends to avoid losing data.

### 23. Microsoft: How do you handle event loop blocking in Azure Functions?
**Expected Answer**: Use async/await patterns, implement proper timeout handling, use external services for heavy processing, and monitor function execution metrics.

### 24. Meta: Design a Node.js service that processes millions of social media posts without blocking.
**Expected Answer**: Implement message queues, use worker processes, implement proper batching, use streaming APIs, and design for horizontal scaling.

### 25. Netflix: How do you ensure video streaming APIs don't block under high load?
**Expected Answer**: Implement proper caching, use CDNs, design async APIs, implement circuit breakers, use load balancing, and monitor performance metrics.

## Advanced Event Loop Questions

### 26. How does the event loop interact with libuv?
**Expected Answer**: libuv provides the event loop implementation, handles I/O operations, manages thread pools for file system operations, and provides cross-platform abstractions.

### 27. What's the difference between the event loop in Node.js vs browsers?
**Expected Answer**: Node.js has more phases, different task prioritization, server-specific optimizations, and different APIs (process.nextTick doesn't exist in browsers).

### 28. How do Worker Threads affect the main event loop?
**Expected Answer**: Worker threads run in separate event loops, communicate via message passing, don't share memory directly, and allow CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the main thread.

### 29. Explain event loop behavior with async/await vs Promises.
**Expected Answer**: async/await is syntactic sugar over Promises, both use microtasks, but async/await can make debugging easier and provides better error handling patterns.

### 30. How does clustering affect event loop behavior?
**Expected Answer**: Each cluster worker has its own event loop, load is distributed across workers, shared state requires external storage, and proper IPC is needed for coordination.

## Debugging and Monitoring Questions

### 31. How do you profile event loop performance in production?
**Expected Answer**: Use APM tools, implement custom metrics, monitor event loop lag, use flame graphs, and implement proper logging without affecting performance.

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

### 36. What happens when an uncaught exception occurs in an event loop callback?
**Expected Answer**: The process crashes unless handled by `process.on('uncaughtException')`, but this should be used only for cleanup before graceful shutdown.

### 37. How do you handle errors in Promise chains within the event loop?
**Expected Answer**: Use proper `.catch()` handlers, implement global unhandled rejection handlers, use async/await with try/catch, and ensure all Promises are handled.

### 38. What's the behavior of the event loop during process shutdown?
**Expected Answer**: The event loop continues processing until all handles are closed, pending operations complete, or the process is forcefully terminated.

### 39. How do you prevent event loop starvation with recursive callbacks?
**Expected Answer**: Implement yielding mechanisms, use setImmediate() to break up work, implement proper queue management, and monitor execution time.

### 40. Explain event loop behavior with unhandled Promise rejections.
**Expected Answer**: Node.js emits 'unhandledRejection' events, may terminate the process in future versions, and requires proper error handling to prevent crashes.

## Bonus Advanced Questions

### 41. How would you implement a custom event loop phase?
**Expected Answer**: You can't add custom phases, but you can hook into existing phases using setImmediate(), process.nextTick(), or custom scheduling mechanisms.

### 42. Explain the relationship between event loop and garbage collection.
