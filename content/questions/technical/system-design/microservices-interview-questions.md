## Comprehensive Interview Questions

### Service Decomposition and Design

### Q1: How do you decompose a monolithic application into microservices?
**Difficulty:** Senior | **Companies:** Netflix, Amazon, Uber | **Frequency:** Very Common

#### Quick Answer (30 seconds)
Use domain-driven design to identify bounded contexts, analyze data flow and business capabilities, start with the most independent modules, and decompose incrementally using the strangler fig pattern.

#### Detailed Answer (3-5 minutes)
Service decomposition follows a systematic approach:

1. **Domain Analysis**: Identify business capabilities and bounded contexts using domain-driven design
2. **Data Flow Mapping**: Analyze how data flows between different parts of the system
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Identify tight vs loose coupling between components
4. **Team Structure**: Consider Conway's Law - services should align with team boundaries
5. **Incremental Approach**: Use strangler fig pattern to gradually extract services

**Decomposition Strategies:**
- **By Business Capability**: User management, order processing, payment handling
- **By Data**: Services own their data and expose it through APIs
- **By Team**: Each team owns specific services end-to-end
- **By Technology**: Different services can use different tech stacks
#### 
Code Example
```javascript
// Before: Monolithic e-commerce structure
class ECommerceApp {
  userManagement() { /* user logic */ }
  productCatalog() { /* product logic */ }
  orderProcessing() { /* order logic */ }
  paymentHandling() { /* payment logic */ }
  inventoryManagement() { /* inventory logic */ }
}

// After: Microservices decomposition
// User Service
class UserService {
  createUser(userData) { /* user creation */ }
  authenticateUser(credentials) { /* authentication */ }
}

// Product Service
class ProductService {
  getProduct(productId) { /* product retrieval */ }
  updateInventory(productId, quantity) { /* inventory update */ }
}

// Order Service
class OrderService {
  createOrder(orderData) {
    // Calls User Service for validation
    // Calls Product Service for availability
    // Calls Payment Service for processing
  }
}
```

#### Real-World Context
Netflix decomposed their monolithic DVD service into 700+ microservices, starting with the most independent components like user recommendations and gradually extracting core services like billing and user management.

#### Common Mistakes
- **Big Bang Approach**: Trying to decompose everything at once instead of incremental extraction
- **Ignoring Data Dependencies**: Not considering shared databases and data consistency requirements
- **Over-decomposition**: Creating too many small services that increase operational complexity
- **Ignoring Team Structure**: Not aligning service boundaries with team responsibilities

#### Follow-up Questions
1. How do you handle shared data between services during decomposition?
2. What's the strangler fig pattern and when would you use it?
3. How do you maintain data consistency during the transition period?

#### Related Topics
- Domain-driven design
- Bounded contexts
- Conway's Law
- Database decomposition strategies

### Q2: What are the key principles for designing microservice boundaries?
**Difficulty:** Senior | **Companies:** Amazon, Google, Microsoft | **Frequency:** Very Common

#### Quick Answer (30 seconds)
Design boundaries around business capabilities, ensure high cohesion within services and loose coupling between services, follow single responsibility principle, and align with team ownership.

#### Detailed Answer (3-5 minutes)
Microservice boundaries should follow these principles:

**1. Business Capability Alignment**
- Each service should represent a complete business capability
- Services should be able to evolve independently
- Boundaries should reflect organizational structure (Conway's Law)

**2. Data Ownership**
- Each service owns its data and database
- No direct database access between services
- Data consistency through eventual consistency patterns

**3. High Cohesion, Loose Coupling**
- Related functionality should be in the same service
- Minimize inter-service communication
- Services should be independently deployable

**4. Size Considerations**
- Small enough to be maintained by a single team (2-pizza rule)
- Large enough to provide meaningful business value
- Consider operational overhead vs business value#
### Code Example
```javascript
// Good: Well-bounded services
class OrderService {
  // Owns order data and business logic
  async createOrder(orderData) {
    const order = await this.validateOrder(orderData);
    await this.reserveInventory(order.items);
    await this.processPayment(order.payment);
    return await this.saveOrder(order);
  }
  
  // Internal methods - high cohesion
  private validateOrder(orderData) { /* validation logic */ }
  private reserveInventory(items) { /* calls inventory service */ }
  private processPayment(payment) { /* calls payment service */ }
}

// Bad: Poorly bounded service
class OrderUserPaymentService {
  // Violates single responsibility
  createUser() { /* user logic */ }
  processOrder() { /* order logic */ }
  handlePayment() { /* payment logic */ }
  // Too many responsibilities, low cohesion
}
```

#### Real-World Context
Amazon's approach: Each service is owned by a team that can build, deploy, and operate it independently. Services like Prime, Recommendations, and Payments have clear business boundaries and minimal dependencies.

#### Common Mistakes
- **Chatty Services**: Creating services that require many inter-service calls
- **Shared Databases**: Multiple services accessing the same database
- **Anemic Services**: Services that are too small and don't provide business value
- **God Services**: Services that try to do too much

#### Follow-up Questions
1. How do you handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication across services?
2. What's the difference between technical and business service boundaries?
3. How do you refactor service boundaries as requirements evolve?

### Communication Patterns and API Design

### Q3: Compare synchronous vs asynchronous communication in microservices. When would you use each?
**Difficulty:** Mid-Senior | **Companies:** Uber, Airbnb, Spotify | **Frequency:** Very Common

#### Quick Answer (30 seconds)
Synchronous communication (REST, GraphQL) is simpler and provides immediate responses but creates tight coupling. Asynchronous communication (message queues, events) enables loose coupling and better resilience but adds complexity. Use sync for real-time queries, async for workflows and notifications.

#### Detailed Answer (3-5 minutes)

**Synchronous Communication:**
- **Protocols**: REST APIs, GraphQL, gRPC
- **Characteristics**: Request-response pattern, immediate feedback, blocking calls
- **Use Cases**: User-facing operations, real-time queries, simple CRUD operations

**Asynchronous Communication:**
- **Protocols**: Message queues (RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka), Event streaming
- **Characteristics**: Fire-and-forget, eventual consistency, non-blocking
- **Use Cases**: Background processing, event notifications, workflow orchestration#### Co
de Example
```javascript
// Synchronous Communication
class OrderService {
  async createOrder(orderData) {
    // Blocking calls - tight coupling
    const user = await userService.getUser(orderData.userId);
    const inventory = await inventoryService.checkAvailability(orderData.items);
    const payment = await paymentService.processPayment(orderData.payment);
    
    if (user && inventory && payment.success) {
      return await this.saveOrder(orderData);
    }
    throw new Error('Order creation failed');
  }
}

// Asynchronous Communication
class OrderService {
  async createOrder(orderData) {
    // Create order immediately
    const order = await this.saveOrder({ ...orderData, status: 'PENDING' });
    
    // Publish events for async processing
    await eventBus.publish('order.created', {
      orderId: order.id,
      userId: orderData.userId,
      items: orderData.items,
      payment: orderData.payment
    });
    
    return order;
  }
}

// Event handlers in other services
class InventoryService {
  async handleOrderCreated(event) {
    const available = await this.checkAvailability(event.items);
    if (available) {
      await this.reserveItems(event.items);
      await eventBus.publish('inventory.reserved', event);
    } else {
      await eventBus.publish('inventory.unavailable', event);
    }
  }
}
```

#### Real-World Context
**Netflix**: Uses async messaging for recommendation updates and content processing, sync APIs for user-facing operations like video streaming.
**Uber**: Async for trip matching and driver location updates, sync for real-time pricing and trip status.

#### Common Mistakes
- **Overusing Sync**: Making everything synchronous, creating cascading failures
- **Complex Async Flows**: Creating overly complex event chains that are hard to debug
- **Mixed Patterns**: Inconsistent use of sync/async within the same workflow
- **No Timeout Handling**: Not implementing proper timeout and retry mechanisms

#### Follow-up Questions
1. How do you handle partial failures in synchronous communication?
2. What's the difference between choreography and orchestration in async workflows?
3. How do you maintain data consistency with asynchronous communication?

### Q4: Explain the role of an API Gateway in microservices architecture.
**Difficulty:** Mid-Senior | **Companies:** Amazon, Netflix, Google | **Frequency:** Very Common

#### Quick Answer (30 seconds)
An API Gateway is a single entry point that routes requests to appropriate microservices, handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring, and provides a unified interface to clients.

#### Detailed Answer (3-5 minutes)
An API Gateway serves as the front door for microservices, providing:

**Core Functions:**
1. **Request Routing**: Routes requests to appropriate backend services
2. **Protocol Translation**: Converts between different protocols (HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC)
3. **Request/Response Transformation**: Modifies requests and responses as needed
4. **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across service instances

**Cross-Cutting Concerns:**
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Centralized security enforcement
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and ensures fair usage
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Centralized logging and metrics collection
- **Caching**: Reduces backend load with response caching#
### Code Example
```javascript
// API Gateway Configuration
class APIGateway {
  constructor() {
    this.routes = new Map();
    this.middleware = [];
    this.setupRoutes();
  }
  
  setupRoutes() {
    // Route definitions
    this.routes.set('/api/users/*', {
      service: 'user-service',
      loadBalancer: 'round-robin',
      timeout: 5000,
      retries: 3
    });
    
    this.routes.set('/api/orders/*', {
      service: 'order-service',
      loadBalancer: 'least-connections',
      timeout: 10000,
      retries: 2
    });
  }
  
  async handleRequest(request) {
    // Apply middleware (auth, rate limiting, etc.)
    for (const middleware of this.middleware) {
      request = await middleware(request);
    }
    
    // Route to appropriate service
    const route = this.findRoute(request.path);
    const serviceInstance = await this.loadBalancer.getInstance(route.service);
    
    try {
      const response = await this.forwardRequest(serviceInstance, request);
      return this.transformResponse(response);
    } catch (error) {
      return this.handleError(error, route);
    }
  }
}

// Authentication Middleware
const authMiddleware = async (request) => {
  const token = request.headers.authorization;
  if (!token) {
    throw new UnauthorizedError('Missing authentication token');
  }
  
  const user = await authService.validateToken(token);
  request.user = user;
  return request;
};

// Rate Limiting Middleware
const rateLimitMiddleware = async (request) => {
  const clientId = request.user?.id || request.ip;
  const allowed = await rateLimiter.checkLimit(clientId);
  
  if (!allowed) {
    throw new RateLimitError('Rate limit exceeded');
  }
  
  return request;
};
```

#### Real-World Context
**Amazon API Gateway**: Handles millions of API calls, provides caching, throttling, and monitoring for AWS services.
**Netflix Zuul**: Routes requests to hundreds of backend services, handles authentication and provides circuit breaker functionality.

#### Common Mistakes
- **Single Point of Failure**: Not making the gateway highly available
- **Performance Bottleneck**: Not optimizing gateway performance for high throughput
- **Overly Complex Logic**: Putting too much business logic in the gateway
- **Tight Coupling**: Making services dependent on gateway-specific features

#### Follow-up Questions
1. How do you handle API versioning through the gateway?
2. What's the difference between API Gateway and Service Mesh?
3. How do you implement circuit breakers in an API Gateway?

### Data Management and Consistency

### Q5: How do you handle distributed transactions in microservices?
**Difficulty:** Senior | **Companies:** Amazon, Google, Uber | **Frequency:** Very Common

#### Quick Answer (30 seconds)
Avoid distributed transactions when possible. Use patterns like Saga pattern for managing distributed workflows, implement eventual consistency, and design for compensation rather than rollback.

#### Detailed Answer (3-5 minutes)
Distributed transactions in microservices are challenging due to the CAP theorem. Here are the main approaches:

**1. Saga Pattern**
- **Choreography**: Services coordinate through events
- **Orchestration**: Central coordinator manages the workflow
- **Compensation**: Each step has a compensating action for rollback

**2. Event Sourcing**
- Store events instead of current state
- Replay events to rebuild state
- Natural audit trail and temporal queries

**3. Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**
- Rarely used due to blocking nature and complexity
- Can cause system-wide locks and failures#### 
Code Example
```javascript
// Saga Pattern - Orchestration Approach
class OrderSagaOrchestrator {
  async processOrder(orderData) {
    const sagaId = generateId();
    const saga = new OrderSaga(sagaId, orderData);
    
    try {
      // Step 1: Reserve inventory
      await saga.execute('reserveInventory', orderData.items);
      
      // Step 2: Process payment
      await saga.execute('processPayment', orderData.payment);
      
      // Step 3: Create order
      await saga.execute('createOrder', orderData);
      
      // Step 4: Send confirmation
      await saga.execute('sendConfirmation', orderData.email);
      
      return saga.complete();
    } catch (error) {
      // Compensate in reverse order
      await saga.compensate();
      throw error;
    }
  }
}

class OrderSaga {
  constructor(sagaId, orderData) {
    this.sagaId = sagaId;
    this.orderData = orderData;
    this.completedSteps = [];
  }
  
  async execute(step, data) {
    const result = await this.executeStep(step, data);
    this.completedSteps.push({ step, data, result });
    return result;
  }
  
  async compensate() {
    // Execute compensation in reverse order
    for (const { step, data, result } of this.completedSteps.reverse()) {
      await this.compensateStep(step, data, result);
    }
  }
  
  async compensateStep(step, data, result) {
    switch (step) {
      case 'reserveInventory':
        await inventoryService.releaseReservation(result.reservationId);
        break;
      case 'processPayment':
        await paymentService.refund(result.transactionId);
        break;
      case 'createOrder':
        await orderService.cancelOrder(result.orderId);
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Real-World Context
**Uber**: Uses saga pattern for trip booking - reserve driver, charge rider, update trip status. If any step fails, compensating actions are triggered.
**Amazon**: Order processing uses eventual consistency - order is created immediately, payment and inventory are processed asynchronously.

#### Common Mistakes
- **Using 2PC**: Trying to implement traditional ACID transactions across services
- **Complex Sagas**: Creating overly complex saga workflows that are hard to debug
- **No Compensation Logic**: Not implementing proper rollback mechanisms
- **Ignoring Partial Failures**: Not handling scenarios where compensation itself fails

#### Follow-up Questions
1. What's the difference between choreography and orchestration in saga patterns?
2. How do you handle timeout scenarios in distributed transactions?
3. What are the trade-offs between eventual consistency and strong consistency?

### Deployment and Orchestration

### Q6: Explain containerization and orchestration strategies for microservices.
**Difficulty:** Senior | **Companies:** Google, Amazon, Microsoft | **Frequency:** Very Common

#### Quick Answer (30 seconds)
Containerization packages services with their dependencies for consistent deployment. Kubernetes orchestrates containers with features like service discovery, load balancing, auto-scaling, and rolling deployments. Docker provides the containerization platform.

#### Detailed Answer (3-5 minutes)

**Containerization Benefits:**
- **Consistency**: Same environment across dev, test, and production
- **Isolation**: Services run in isolated environments
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better resource utilization than VMs
- **Portability**: Run anywhere containers are supported

**Kubernetes Orchestration:**
- **Pod Management**: Groups of containers that share resources
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic service registration and discovery
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic distribution across pod instances
- **Auto-scaling**: Horizontal and vertical scaling based on metrics
- **Rolling Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments#### C
ode Example
```yaml
# Dockerfile for Node.js microservice
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
USER node
CMD ["npm", "start"]

            port: 3000
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
```

#### Real-World Context
**Google**: Runs billions of containers using Kubernetes (originally called Borg internally). Services auto-scale based on traffic patterns.
**Netflix**: Uses containerization for their microservices, with custom orchestration tools before adopting Kubernetes.

#### Common Mistakes
- **Large Container Images**: Not optimizing Docker images for size and security
- **No Resource Limits**: Not setting proper CPU and memory limits
- **Poor Health Checks**: Inadequate liveness and readiness probes
- **Stateful Services**: Running stateful services without proper persistent storage

#### Follow-up Questions
1. How do you handle persistent storage in containerized microservices?
2. What's the difference between liveness and readiness probes?
3. How do you implement blue-green deployments with Kubernetes?

## Real-World Scenarios
