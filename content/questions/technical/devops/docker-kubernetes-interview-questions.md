#### Quick Answer (30 seconds)
Multi-stage builds use multiple FROM statements to separate build and runtime environments, reducing final image size and attack surface.

#### Detailed Answer (3-5 minutes)
Multi-stage builds optimize container images by separating build dependencies from runtime requirements:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

# Development dependencies stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS dev-deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Build application
FROM dev-deps AS build
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
RUN npm run test

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS production
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build /app/package.json ./package.json
USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced image size (build tools excluded)
- Improved security (fewer attack vectors)

metadata:
  name: calico-config
data:
  cni_network_config: |
    {
      "name": "k8s-pod-network",
      "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
      "plugins": [
        {
          "type": "calico",
          "log_level": "info",
          "datastore_type": "kubernetes",
          "mtu": 1440,
          "ipam": {
            "type": "calico-ipam"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
```

### Q10: Explain Kubernetes resource management and quality of service classes
**Difficulty:** Senior | **Companies:** Google, Amazon, Meta | **Frequency:** Common

#### Quick Answer (30 seconds)
Kubernetes provides three QoS classes (Guaranteed, Burstable, BestEffort) based on resource requests and limits to manage pod scheduling and eviction.

#### Detailed Answer (3-5 minutes)
Kubernetes resource management ensures fair resource allocation and cluster stability:

**Quality of Service Classes:**

**Guaranteed QoS:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: "500m"
      limits:
        memory: "1Gi"  # Same as requests
        cpu: "500m"    # Same as requests
```
- Highest priority for scheduling
- Last to be evicted under pressure
- Resources guaranteed by kubelet

**Burstable QoS:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "512Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "1Gi"   # Higher than requests
        cpu: "1000m"    # Higher than requests
```
- Medium priority for scheduling
- Can use more resources when available
- Evicted based on resource usage vs requests

**BestEffort QoS:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    # No resource requests or limits
```
- Lowest priority for scheduling
- First to be evicted under pressure
- Uses whatever resources are available

**Resource Management Strategies:**
```yaml
# Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: app
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
```

#### Real-World Context
Production clusters typically use Guaranteed QoS for critical services, Burstable for most applications, and BestEffort for batch jobs.

#### Common Mistakes
- Not setting resource requests and limits
- Setting limits too low causing throttling
- Not understanding QoS impact on scheduling
- Ignoring resource monitoring and optimization

#### Follow-up Questions

A production Kubernetes cluster hosting critical microservices experiences a complete control plane failure during peak traffic. The cluster serves 10,000+ requests per second and must be restored within 2 hours to meet SLA requirements.

### Technical Challenges
1. **Control Plane Failure**: All master nodes are unresponsive
2. **Data Integrity**: Ensure no data loss from persistent workloads
3. **Service Continuity**: Minimize downtime for critical services
4. **State Recovery**: Restore cluster state from backups
5. **Traffic Management**: Handle traffic during recovery

### Solution Approach

**Phase 1: Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)**
```bash
# Assess cluster state
kubectl get nodes --kubeconfig=/backup/admin.conf
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --kubeconfig=/backup/admin.conf

# Check etcd cluster health
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://etcd1:2379,https://etcd2:2379,https://etcd3:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
  endpoint health

# Activate disaster recovery procedures
./scripts/activate-dr-cluster.sh
```

**Phase 2: Traffic Failover (15-30 minutes)**
```yaml
# Update DNS to point to DR cluster
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: api-gateway-dr
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: api-gateway
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
---
# Scale up DR cluster services
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: critical-service-dr
spec:
  replicas: 10  # Scale up for increased load
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: critical-service:v1.2.3
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 1Gi
          limits:
            cpu: 1000m
            memory: 2Gi
```

**Phase 3: Primary Cluster Recovery (30-90 minutes)**
```bash
# Restore etcd from backup
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore /backup/etcd-snapshot.db \
  --name etcd1 \
  --initial-cluster etcd1=https://10.0.1.10:2380,etcd2=https://10.0.1.11:2380,etcd3=https://10.0.1.12:2380 \
  --initial-cluster-token etcd-cluster-1 \
  --initial-advertise-peer-urls https://10.0.1.10:2380

# Restart control plane components
systemctl start etcd
systemctl start kube-apiserver
systemctl start kube-controller-manager
systemctl start kube-scheduler

# Verify cluster health
kubectl get componentstatuses
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

**Phase 4: Data Synchronization (90-120 minutes)**
```yaml
# Restore persistent volumes from snapshots
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: database-restore
spec:
  volumeSnapshotClassName: csi-snapshotter
  source:
    volumeSnapshotContentName: database-backup-content
---
# Sync data between clusters
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: data-sync
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: sync
        image: data-sync:latest
        command: ["./sync-databases.sh"]
        env:
        - name: SOURCE_DB
          value: "dr-cluster-db"
        - name: TARGET_DB
          value: "primary-cluster-db"
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Detection Time**: 3 minutes (automated monitoring)
- **Failover Time**: 15 minutes to DR cluster
- **Recovery Time**: 90 minutes total
- **Data Loss**: Zero (point-in-time recovery)
- **Service Availability**: 99.7% maintained

### Lessons Learned
1. **Automation**: Automated DR procedures reduce recovery time by 60%
2. **Testing**: Regular DR drills identify gaps in procedures
3. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring enables faster detection
4. **Documentation**: Clear runbooks are critical during high-stress situations
5. **Communication**: Stakeholder communication plan is essential

### Interview Questions from This Scenario

## Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Container Deployment Issues

### Q11: A container fails to start with "CrashLoopBackOff" status. Walk through your debugging approach.
**Difficulty:** Senior | **Companies:** All | **Frequency:** Very Common

#### Quick Answer (30 seconds)
Check container logs, examine resource constraints, verify image and configuration, and analyze startup dependencies.

#### Detailed Answer (3-5 minutes)
Systematic approach to debugging CrashLoopBackOff:

**Step 1: Gather Information**
```bash
# Check pod status and events
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp

# Examine container logs
kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name> --previous
```

**Step 2: Common Root Causes**

**Resource Constraints:**
```yaml
# Check resource limits
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "64Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "128Mi"  # Too low?
    cpu: "500m"
```

**Configuration Issues:**
```bash
# Verify ConfigMap and Secret mounts
kubectl get configmap <config-name> -o yaml
kubectl get secret <secret-name> -o yaml

# Check environment variables
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- env
```

**Image Problems:**
```bash
# Verify image exists and is accessible
docker pull <image-name>
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> | grep -A5 "Failed to pull image"
```

**Step 3: Advanced Debugging**
```bash
# Run container interactively
kubectl run debug --image=<same-image> -it --rm -- /bin/sh

# Check filesystem permissions
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- ls -la /app
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- id

# Network connectivity
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- nslookup kubernetes.default
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- wget -O- http://service-name:port/health
```

#### Real-World Context
Most CrashLoopBackOff issues (70%) are caused by configuration errors, resource constraints, or missing dependencies.

#### Common Mistakes
- Not checking previous container logs
- Ignoring resource constraints
- Not verifying image architecture compatibility
- Overlooking init container failures

#### Follow-up Questions
1. How do you debug intermittent container crashes?
2. What tools do you use for container performance analysis?

### Q12: Kubernetes pods are experiencing intermittent network connectivity issues. How do you diagnose and resolve this?
**Difficulty:** Senior | **Companies:** Netflix, Uber, Google | **Frequency:** Common

#### Quick Answer (30 seconds)
Systematically check CNI plugin health, DNS resolution, network policies, and service endpoints while monitoring network traffic.

#### Detailed Answer (3-5 minutes)
Network troubleshooting requires layered analysis:

**Step 1: Basic Connectivity Tests**
```bash
# Test pod-to-pod communication
kubectl exec -it pod1 -- ping <pod2-ip>
kubectl exec -it pod1 -- telnet <service-name> <port>

# Check DNS resolution
kubectl exec -it pod1 -- nslookup kubernetes.default
kubectl exec -it pod1 -- dig @10.96.0.10 service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local
```

**Step 2: CNI Plugin Diagnostics**
```bash
# Check CNI plugin status
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep -E "(calico|flannel|weave)"
kubectl logs -n kube-system <cni-pod-name>

# Verify network configuration
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl describe node <node-name> | grep -A10 "PodCIDR"
```

**Step 3: Service and Endpoint Analysis**
```bash
# Check service configuration
kubectl get svc <service-name> -o yaml
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>

# Verify iptables rules (on nodes)
sudo iptables -t nat -L | grep <service-name>
sudo ipvsadm -L -n | grep <service-ip>
```

**Step 4: Network Policy Investigation**
```bash
# Check network policies
kubectl get networkpolicies --all-namespaces
kubectl describe networkpolicy <policy-name>

# Test with policy temporarily disabled
kubectl label namespace <namespace> name=debug-no-policy
```

**Advanced Debugging Tools:**
```yaml
# Network debugging pod
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: network-debug
spec:
  containers:
  - name: debug
    image: nicolaka/netshoot
    command: ["sleep", "3600"]
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN"]
---
# Run network analysis
kubectl exec -it network-debug -- tcpdump -i any host <target-ip>
kubectl exec -it network-debug -- traceroute <target-ip>
kubectl exec -it network-debug -- ss -tulpn
```

#### Real-World Context
Intermittent network issues often stem from DNS caching, load balancer health checks, or CNI plugin resource exhaustion during high traffic.

#### Common Mistakes
- Not checking DNS cache TTL settings
- Ignoring network policy impacts
- Not monitoring CNI plugin resource usage
- Overlooking service mesh configuration

#### Follow-up Questions
1. How do you monitor network performance in Kubernetes?
2. What's your approach to network policy testing?

### Q13: How do you implement zero-downtime deployments with advanced rollback strategies?
**Difficulty:** Senior | **Companies:** Netflix, Amazon, Google | **Frequency:** Common

#### Quick Answer (30 seconds)
Use rolling updates with readiness probes, implement blue-green or canary deployments, and maintain automated rollback triggers based on health metrics.

#### Detailed Answer (3-5 minutes)
Zero-downtime deployments require careful orchestration and monitoring:

**Rolling Update Strategy:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api-service
spec:
  replicas: 10
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1      # Only 1 pod down at a time
      maxSurge: 2           # Up to 2 extra pods during update
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: api
        image: api-service:v2.1.0
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health/ready
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          periodSeconds: 5
          failureThreshold: 3
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health/live
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
```

**Blue-Green Deployment:**
```yaml
# Blue environment (current)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api-blue
  labels:
    version: blue
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api
      version: blue
---
# Green environment (new)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api-green
  labels:
    version: green
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api
      version: green
---
# Service switching
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: api-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: api
    version: blue  # Switch to green after validation
```

**Canary Deployment with Istio:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: api-canary
spec:
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        canary:
          exact: "true"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: api-service
        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: api-service
        subset: v1
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: api-service
        subset: v2
      weight: 10  # 10% traffic to new version
```

**Automated Rollback Strategy:**
```yaml
# Prometheus alerting rule
groups:
- name: deployment.rules
  rules:
  - alert: HighErrorRate
    expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.1
    for: 2m
    annotations:
      summary: "High error rate detected"
      description: "Error rate is {{ $value }} for 2 minutes"
---
# Rollback automation
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: auto-rollback
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: rollback
        image: kubectl:latest
        command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - |
          if [ "$(kubectl get deployment api-service -o jsonpath='{.status.readyReplicas}')" -lt "8" ]; then
            kubectl rollout undo deployment/api-service
            kubectl rollout status deployment/api-service
          fi
```
