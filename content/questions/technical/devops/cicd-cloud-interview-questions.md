## Pipeline Design & Architecture

### 1. Pipeline Strategy Questions

**Q1: Design a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices application with 15+ services. How would you handle dependencies and ensure efficient builds?**

**Expected Answer:**
- **Monorepo vs Multi-repo strategy**: Discuss trade-offs
- **Dependency graph analysis**: Build only affected services
- **Parallel execution**: Services without dependencies build simultaneously
- **Shared libraries**: Versioning and artifact management
- **Pipeline orchestration**: Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions

**Follow-up:** How would you handle a scenario where Service A depends on Service B, but Service B's tests are failing?

---

**Q2: You have a legacy monolithic application that takes 45 minutes to build and test. How would you optimize the CI/CD pipeline?**

**Expected Answer:**
- **Build optimization**: Incremental builds, caching strategies
- **Test parallelization**: Split tests across multiple runners
- **Docker layer caching**: Optimize Dockerfile for better caching
- **Artifact reuse**: Cache dependencies and build artifacts
- **Pipeline stages**: Fail fast with quick smoke tests first

**Real-world scenario:** At Netflix, they reduced build times from 40+ minutes to under 10 minutes using these strategies.

---

**Q3: Explain the difference between push-based and pull-based deployment models. When would you use each?**

**Expected Answer:**
- **Push-based (Traditional CI/CD)**: CI system pushes changes to target environment
  - Pros: Immediate feedback, centralized control
  - Cons: Security concerns, credential management
- **Pull-based (GitOps)**: Target environment pulls changes from Git
  - Pros: Better security, declarative state, audit trail
  - Cons: Potential delays, complexity in troubleshooting

**Use cases:**
- Push-based: Development/staging environments, immediate deployments
- Pull-based: Production environments, regulated industries

---

### 2. Advanced Pipeline Patterns

**Q4: Design a pipeline that supports both feature branch deployments and production releases. How would you handle environment promotion?**

**Expected Answer:**
```yaml
# Example pipeline structure
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - security-scan
  - feature-deploy    # For feature branches
  - integration-test
  - staging-deploy    # For main branch
  - production-deploy # Manual approval required

environments:
  feature: dynamic-${BRANCH_NAME}
  staging: staging
  production: production
```

**Key considerations:**
- Environment isolation and resource management
- Database migration strategies
- Configuration management across environments
- Rollback procedures

---

**Q5: How would you implement a pipeline that automatically scales based on the number of concurrent builds?**

**Expected Answer:**
- **Auto-scaling build agents**: Kubernetes-based runners, AWS ECS/Fargate
- **Queue management**: Build prioritization and resource allocation
- **Cost optimization**: Spot instances, preemptible VMs
- **Monitoring**: Build queue length, agent utilization metrics

**Implementation example:**
```yaml
# GitHub Actions with auto-scaling
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16, 18, 20]
      max-parallel: 10  # Scale based on available runners
```

---

## Testing Strategies in CI/CD

### 3. Automated Testing Integration

**Q6: Design a testing strategy for a CI/CD pipeline that includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. How would you balance speed vs coverage?**

**Expected Answer:**
```
Testing Pyramid in CI/CD:
┌─────────────────┐
│   E2E Tests     │ ← Slow, high confidence, run on main branch
├─────────────────┤
│ Integration     │ ← Medium speed, API/DB tests
├─────────────────┤
│   Unit Tests    │ ← Fast, high coverage, run on every commit
└─────────────────┘
```

**Pipeline stages:**
1. **Fast feedback**: Unit tests + linting (< 5 minutes)
2. **Integration**: API tests, database tests (< 15 minutes)
3. **E2E**: Critical user journeys only (< 30 minutes)
4. **Performance**: Load tests on staging

---

**Q7: How would you handle flaky tests in a CI/CD pipeline without blocking deployments?**

**Expected Answer:**
- **Test quarantine**: Separate flaky tests from main suite
- **Retry mechanisms**: Smart retry with exponential backoff
- **Test analytics**: Track flakiness metrics and patterns
- **Parallel execution**: Run tests multiple times in parallel
- **Non-blocking mode**: Allow deployment with warnings

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Jest retry configuration
module.exports = {
  testRunner: 'jest-circus/runner',
  testRetries: 3,
  testTimeout: 30000,
  // Quarantine flaky tests
  testPathIgnorePatterns: ['<rootDir>/tests/quarantine/']
};
```

---

**Q8: Explain how you would implement contract testing in a microservices CI/CD pipeline.**

**Expected Answer:**
- **Consumer-driven contracts**: Pact, Spring Cloud Contract
- **Provider verification**: Automated contract verification
- **Contract evolution**: Backward compatibility checks
- **Integration with CI**: Contract tests run before deployment

**Pipeline integration:**
```yaml
contract-tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run test:contract:consumer
    - npm run test:contract:provider
  artifacts:
    reports:
      junit: pact-results.xml
```

---

## Deployment Patterns

### 4. Advanced Deployment Strategies

**Q9: Compare blue-green, canary, and rolling deployments. When would you use each pattern?**

**Expected Answer:**

| Pattern | Use Case | Pros | Cons |
|---------|----------|------|------|
| **Blue-Green** | Critical systems, instant rollback needed | Zero downtime, instant rollback | Resource intensive, database challenges |
| **Canary** | Risk mitigation, gradual rollout | Risk reduction, real user feedback | Complex routing, longer deployment time |
| **Rolling** | Standard applications, resource constraints | Resource efficient, gradual rollout | Partial state during deployment |

**Real-world examples:**
- **Netflix**: Canary deployments with automated rollback based on error rates
- **Amazon**: Blue-green for critical services, rolling for standard services
- **Google**: Canary with traffic splitting based on user segments

---

**Q10: Design a canary deployment strategy that automatically rolls back based on error rates and latency metrics.**

**Expected Answer:**
```yaml
# Canary deployment configuration
canary:
  steps:
    - setWeight: 10    # 10% traffic to canary
    - pause: 300s      # Wait 5 minutes
    - analysis:
        metrics:
          - name: error-rate
            threshold: 5%
          - name: latency-p99
            threshold: 500ms
        failureLimit: 2
    - setWeight: 50    # If healthy, increase to 50%
    - pause: 600s
    - analysis: # Repeat analysis
    - setWeight: 100   # Full rollout
```

**Monitoring integration:**
- Prometheus/Grafana for metrics collection
- Automated rollback triggers
- Slack/PagerDuty notifications

---

**Q11: How would you handle database migrations in a zero-downtime deployment?**

**Expected Answer:**
- **Backward-compatible migrations**: Additive changes first
- **Multi-phase approach**:
  1. Add new columns/tables (backward compatible)
  2. Deploy application code that uses both old and new schema
  3. Migrate data in background
  4. Remove old columns/tables in subsequent deployment

**Example strategy:**
```sql
-- Phase 1: Add new column
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Phase 2: Populate new column
UPDATE users SET email_verified = (verification_status = 'verified');

-- Phase 3: Remove old column (next deployment)
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN verification_status;
```
